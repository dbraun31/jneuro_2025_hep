This is essentially a code dump for the paper linked to above. This
repository uses mainly Python for preprocessing and R for visualization. 

The scripts all depend on having BIDS formatted data in this repository
located at `analysis/data/rawdata`.

Everything related to preprocessing is in the `preprocessing` directory.

The analyses themselves are organized by which figure they contribute to,
and can be found in `analysis`. 

To adhere to our data sharing agreements, I'm stripping this repository of
all data and txt files.

While I haven't had the time to thoroughly organize this repository, my
hope is that the layout of the code may be useful for those trying to do
similar analyses.
